# Kel's Resume
This is a HTML resume to show some of the things we learned in class. I will display how tags, selectors, images and links are defined on website. The resume only displays my most recent
job. I included some of the skills I obtained to increase my value to my business owners.

2/17/2020 - I made the updates you suggested. Please review when you get a moment and provide feedback. Kel
